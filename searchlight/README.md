# Classification Searchlight Analysis Pipeline

Here is how the analysis pipeline was built and deployed:

1. Utilized Jupyter notebook(s) for building and testing the pipeline on a single subject
2. Ran ['rr_pd_sl_accuracy.py']('searchlight/rr_pd_sl_accuracy.py') for single classifier metric: accuracy

Note: ['rr_pd_sl_batch.py']('searchlight/rr_pd_sl_batch.py') is used to run the scripts in batch such that the script is deployed for each subject

Analysis has now been run!
